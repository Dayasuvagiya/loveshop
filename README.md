Our goal is to provide users with a curated selection of timeless classics, innovative personalized items, and expressive tokens of affection.

## Project Management

### Github Project Board

The Project Board facilitated a comprehensive overview of the project, breaking down tasks, features, and milestones into manageable cards. This approach allowed us to maintain a structured and organized workflow, ensuring that each component of Love Shop was systematically addressed.

## Demo

### A live demo to the website can be found [here](https://loveshop-037a9f640521.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

In the initial design phase of Love Shop, we utilized Figma to create a comprehensive wireframe, providing a visual blueprint for the e-commerce platform. Figma's collaborative features facilitated real-time teamwork, ensuring a cohesive visualization of the user interface. The wireframe outlines essential elements, including navigation menus and product displays, guiding a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## User stories

The integration of user stories derived from our wireframe designs on the Project Board has been instrumental. It provided a clear linkage between design concepts and functional requirements, ensuring that the development team was aligned with the envisioned user experience. This connection between design and implementation has been crucial in delivering a product that not only meets technical specifications but also aligns seamlessly with the intended user journey.

### Strategy


### Scope


**Website Sections:**




### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. The site has a main login page which wen completed opens to a dashboard page. On this dashboard there are multiple tabs which the user can use to navigate the various tools availiable to them. 

**Wireframes**
The wireframes were designed using Balsamiq software. These designs were completed at the inception of our project and may not be a true representation of how the site looks today.
