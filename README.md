## UX


## User stories



### Strategy


### Scope


**Website Sections:**




### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. The site has a main login page which wen completed opens to a dashboard page. On this dashboard there are multiple tabs which the user can use to navigate the various tools availiable to them. 

**Wireframes**
The wireframes were designed using Balsamiq software. These designs were completed at the inception of our project and may not be a true representation of how the site looks today.

### Planning

### Surface

The color pallette for the site was chosen because it matched the colour associated with currency and also provided good contrast and accessibility. The font family was chosen as it is easy to read.

| Hex | RGB |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| #244c3c | (36,76,60) |
| #526c5b | (82,108,91) |
| #dcdcbb | (220,220,187) |
| #425e6a | (66,94,106) |
| #fa6e06 | (250,110,6) |

## Features

### Existing Features


 

### Features Left to Implement

In the future we would like to add,

* A feature where the user could take a photo of a receipt and the information would autofil the required fields. 
* An account page the user could customise with a profile picture.
* A more in depth settings section where users could customise the UI of the page including themes and tabs available in the dashboard. 
* An addition to the profile page where the user can select the currency they wish to view their finances in
* Add more personalised style to the dashboard tab sections 

## Testing

* We tested the site, and it works in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
* We confirmed that the site is responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

- git commit -m “commit message” - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

- git push - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.
